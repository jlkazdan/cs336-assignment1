- The encoder is very slow.  Probably I can improve the speed significantly
- Can we use einops in the Linear module instead?
- How should I initialize the learnable gains?
- I don't understand how to make the swiglu load from the state dictionary
- The dimension of the attention heads is non-dynamic at this point
- Need to optimize the transformer with rope so that it involves only a single matrix multiply
- I am not actually setting the datatypes (for instance in the embedding function)
